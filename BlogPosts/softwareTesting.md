# Looking back...
## A humble beginnig:

Testing saw its origins after World War 2, but it was nothing close to what we now know as Quality Assurance or really any methodology for developing a software project, in fact __there was no testing at all…__ people were just focusing on *fixing whatever issues their programs had without taking any considerations on future use cases*. 

This meant just using __print statements to see where the code broke and patching it__. Of course, this all led to __poorly maintained programs__ and larger projects were easy to lose track of. It goes without saying that __documentation was practically non-existent__ and the programmers themselves were the documentation… __*Yes, the meme was real.*__

__This was costing organizations and companies a lot of money when it meant that nothing was reliable and everything could break any second. So something had to be done.__

## Software Development : The Testing Awakens
Around 1960 __debugging tools began to appear__ as a solution to this problem and for the first time software was used to help maintain software itself. A decade later:
- Unit testing was used to test individual components
- New testing methodologies such as structured testing and top-down testing appeared. 

__*It wasn't until the late 1980s and 1990s that the industry and organizations saw an opportunity to improve software quality*__ and introduced different standards like the  ISO 9000 series which worked as a guideline for software management. 


__The 2000s saw the beginning of Agile methodologies which revolved around not only maintaining code but making sure that the development of it was done correctly in the first place.__

__*-Agile is an important methodology born in 2001 and the main practice for developing software at the moment. Its main focus is developing quality software while taking in consideration the customers feedback and also being able to adapt and apply changes as the project progresses.-*__

    Test-Driven Development also gained notoriety for its efficiency in making sure that codebases were robust and stable by establishing the tests before even writing a single line of code. 

## The future...

__As technology evolved, testing became a thing of its own, and as important as writing code. 
This allowed projects to be stable, well documented and revised on frequent iterations…__

Today, we have software fields that focus strictly on testing like DevOps and the development of new technologies are aimed towards improving testing practices. A clear example of this is the use of AI for analysis, prediction and automation of testing large codebases. 

__*It's fun to look back at the beginnings of testing because software was so casual 
(yet so important for the foundation of what technology is nowadays) that the few people that could code didn't feel the need to formalize any sort of guidelines to how the code should work like any construction, architectural or really any “serious” project would.*__

Sure, __technology__ and specifically __writing code__ can be seen as a not so serious activity for people outside the industry, but testing and Quality Assurance is what really __makes it possible for us to have the monumental projects we do and the technological world we live in.__


This doesn't mean that all codebases are well documented and bugs are non existent… that would just be impossible, in fact, software is a thing of its own and... __*at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how reliable codebases are, it all truly comes down to some random project that one guy maintains and it happens to be the support of all technological infrastructure in the world.*__
